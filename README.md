## **Project Overview**
The objective of the project is to predict peptide 3-mers from Tandem Mass Spectra (MS2) data using deep learning models. Our approach was to build a model capable of accurately identifying 3-mers from mass spectra, enhancing peptide identification without relying on pre-built peptide databases.

## **Project Goals**
Tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) is a technique used to break down peptides into smaller fragments, creating a mass spectrum (or "fingerprint") of ions. This project aims to:

- Build a deep learning model that can predict 3-mers (sets of three amino acids) based on MS2 spectra.
- Use both feature-based and sequence-based approaches for analyzing spectra.
- Evaluate model performance in identifying 3-mers from MS2 spectra.
